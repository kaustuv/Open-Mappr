## Synopsis

This Software was built for Vibrant Data Labs by Brainvise as a tool for Eric L. Berlow PhD. The software takes users through 3 stages. Issue Listing, Issue Curation, and Remote Link Mapping. Currently the software is in an extremely alpha phase, but we plan on organizing and restructuring the software and opening it up with an API in the near future. 

## Installation

This project was built using Codeigniter (a php framework) and jQuery (a javascript framework). If you are not familiar with either of these, please take the time to do some research. 

The mysql database is located in the root folder and named "mappr_db.sql". Install this database on your server.

Edit the "database.php" file located in the "application->config" folder to reflect the name of the newly created database as well as your login information. Specifically edit the fields corresponding to "<USER NAME>", "<USER PASSWORD>", and "<DATABASE NAME>".

Upload all files located in the "Open Mappr" directory to the root directory for the domain.

Visit the domain where you've uploaded the files and login with the following:

user: new@vibrantdatalabs.org

password: abcd1234

Create a new Admin User. Check your email to confirm registration for this new admin user and finish setting up your account by visiting the link in the email. 

Delete the admin user: new@vibrantdatalabs.org
